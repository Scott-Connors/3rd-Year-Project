```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

First the data needs to be read into R.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
haddock_data <- read_csv("Haddock_Data.csv")
```

I want to create a tibble with the total length of fish caught per year.

```{r}
annual_length <- haddock_data %>% group_by(Year) %>% summarise(annual_predator_length = sum(`Mean length of predator`))
```
